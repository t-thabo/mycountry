            KwaZulu-Natal, one of the country’s most popular holiday destinations, is the province with the second largest population. This verdant region includes South Africa’s lush subtropical east coast. Washed by the warm Indian Ocean, it stretches from Port Edward in the south, and northwards to the Mozambique boundary.
            In addition to the magnifcent coastline, there is the sweeping savanna in the east, and the majestic Drakensberb mountain range in the west that offers some of the country’s most awe-inspiring landscapes.
            Within the area is a vast 243 000-hectare sweep of basalt summits and buttresses. This section was formally granted World Heritage status in November 2000, and was renamed uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park.
            Visitors can enter the province through the King Shaka International Airport at La Mercy, north of Durban or use the extensive national road network. There are also two major harbours – the port of Durban, which is one the busiest in Africa, and Richards Bay, which is an important coal-export harbour.
            There are several tertiary institutions of learning, such as the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the Durban Institute of Technology.
            KwaZulu-Natal is the only province with a monarchy specifically provided for in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa of 1996.
