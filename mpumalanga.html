            Mpumalanga means Place where the sun rises. Due to the provinces spectacular scenic beauty and abundance of wildlife, it is one of South Africa’s major tourist destinations. Mpumalanga falls mainly within the Grassland Biome.

            The area has a network of excellent roads and railway connections, making it highly accessible. Mpumalanga is also served by a number of small airports, such as the Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport.
            Mbombela is the capital of the province and the administrative and business centre of the Lowveld. Other important towns are eMalahleni, Standerton, Piet Retief, Malalane, Ermelo, Barberton and Sabie.

            The Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains were added to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s prestigious World Heritage List in July 2018, becoming the 10th World Heritage Site for South Africa.
            The site comprises 40% of the Barberton Greenstone Belt, one of the world’s oldest geological structures.
            The Barberton Makhonjwa Mountains represent the best-preserved succession of volcanic and sedimentary rock dating back 3,25 to 3,6 billion years.
