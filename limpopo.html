            Limpopo, South Africa’s northernmost province, borders onto Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana, making it the ideal entrance to Africa.
            Named after the Limpopo River that flows along its northern border, the province is rich in wildlife, spectacular scenery and a wealth of historical and cultural treasures.
            This province is in the Savanna Biome, an area of mixed grassland and trees, which is generally known as bushveld.
            The province’s natural resources include more than 50 provincial reserves, as well as several private game reserves. The largest section of the Kruger National Park is situated along the eastern boundary of Limpopo with Mozambique.
