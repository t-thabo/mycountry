            The Eastern Cape(link is external), lying on the south-eastern South African coast, is a region of great natural beauty, particularly the rugged cliffs, rough seas and dense green bush of the stretch known as the Wild Coast.
            In the Eastern Cape, various floral habitats meet. Along the coast, the northern tropical forests intermingle with the more temperate woods of the south.
            The province is serviced by airports situated in Port Elizabeth, East London, Mthatha and Bhisho.
