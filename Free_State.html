            The Free State, a province of wide horizons and blue skies, farmland, mountains, goldfields and widely dispersed towns, lies in the heart of South Africa.
            Between the Vaal River in the north and the Orange River in the south, this immense rolling prairie stretches as far as the eye can see.
            Mining, particularly gold, is the biggest employer, followed by manufacturing.
            The Free State also produces high-quality diamonds from its kimberlite pipes and fissures, and the country’s largest deposit of bentonite is found in the Koppies district.
            The National Development Plan has intensified the mining potential that still exists in the goldfields region of Matjhabeng in the Lejweleputswa District as a job intervention zone.
            The capital, Bloemfontein, houses the Supreme Court of Appeal, a leading university and some top schools. Important towns include Welkom, Sasolburg, Odendaalsrus, Kroonstad, Parys, Phuthaditjhaba, Bethlehem.
            The charming village of Clarens situated in the rolling foothills of the Maluti Mountains. Some of South Africa’s most valued San rock art can be found in the Free State.
            Other key tourist attractions in the province include the majestic Golden Gate National Park, the annual air show in Bethlehem, the Cherry Festival in Ficksburg, and the Fauresmith  International Endurance Ride equestrian event.
            The annual Mangaung African Cultural Festival, known as Macufe, is hosted in partnership with the Tourism Authority and the Performing Arts Centre of the Free State.
            The Vredefort Dome, 10 km in diameter, is on the United Nations’ (UN) World Heritage Site List.
