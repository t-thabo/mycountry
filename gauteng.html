            Gauteng is the smallest of South Africaâ€™s nine provinces but comprises the largest share of the South African population. Financial and business services, logistics, manufacturing, property, telecommunications and trade are some of the most important economic sectors.
            The province is an integrated industrial complex with major areas of economic activity in three subregional areas, namely the Vaal Triangle; the East, West and Central Rand, and Pretoria.
            Johannesburg houses the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited, the largest securities exchange in Africa.
            Most overseas visitors enter South Africa via OR Tambo International Airport. Some 50 km north of Johannesburg lies Pretoria, the administrative capital of South Africa and home to the Union Buildings.
